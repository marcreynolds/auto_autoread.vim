*auto_autoread.txt* Read files when they've changed (this does what 'autoread'
promised to do but doesn't do).

INTRODUCTION                                      *auto-autoread-introduction*

Automatically read files when they've changed. This plugin requires |+python|
or |+python3|.

This is different from the built-in 'autoread' option in that it periodically
checks if the file on the disk has changed, which is _not_ what 'autoread'
does. 'autoread' only checks when a some events occur. To be more precise, when:

    - |:checktime| is used;
    - a buffer is entered;
    - |:diffupdate| is used;
    - |:e| is issued for a file that already has a buffer;
    - executing an external command with |!|;
    - returning to the foreground (^Z, fg, only if the shell has job control).

and for gVim, this is also done when:

    - closing the "right-click" menu (either by selecting something, or just
      by closing it);
    - focus is changed (this is what you already noticed);
    - closing the file browsers dialog that pops up if you use "file -> open",
      "file -> save as" from the menu (as well as some other places).

As you can see, this set is very limited. If you're running Vim in another
window while you're doing something else somewhere else, the buffer never gets
updated.

COMMANDS                                              *auto-autoread-commands*

:Autoread [N]                                                      *:Autoread*
                Start checking if the file is changed. The file will be checked
                every {N} seconds. If {N} is not given, a value of {5} is
                used.

                This sets the *b:auto_autoread* variable to {N}, which can be
                modified to change the interval.

                Note that we will still warn if both the buffer and file were
                changed. This is a feature.
